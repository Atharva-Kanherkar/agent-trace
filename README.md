# agent-trace

Self-hosted observability for agentic coding workflows.

## Status

This repository has been reset and is being rebuilt from scratch with strict TypeScript.

Current implementation strategy:

1. Follow `docs/HLD_LLD.md` feature-by-feature.
2. Keep all package contracts in module-level `types.ts` files.
3. Enforce strict typing and maintainable boundaries.
4. Complete each feature with typecheck + unit tests + manual smoke validation.

## Source of truth

- `docs/HLD_LLD.md`
